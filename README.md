Minimal [hdr histogram](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/) implementation in rust

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/streaming-harness-hdrhist.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/streaming-harness-hdrhist)

This module is a minimal implementation: it does what we need, but there are
alternative, more complete implementations of hdr histograms already.
It's mostly intended to be used as a dependency for the `streaming-harness` crate.

See the `hdrhist` example for usage directions.
