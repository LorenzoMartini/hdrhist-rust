Minimal [hdr histogram](https://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/) implementation in rust

This module is intentionally not published on `crates`: it does what we need, but there are
alternative, more complete implementations of hdr histograms already. It's intended to be
used as a source dependency.

See the `hdrhist` example for usage directions.
